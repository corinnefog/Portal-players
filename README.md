This is a Flask based web app for a summer league baseball team. Players 
are able to login with their last name and a password to see data specific to themsleves from over the course 
of the season. Data includes velocity and spin rate averages, strike percentages, and overall game data.
This project was made for the use of players, college scouts, and coaches. A combination of SQL, python, and
html was used. 3 pngs are included in this repo to show the format of the dashboard. For anonymization purposes, the pitcher's name is blacked out in all pages.
